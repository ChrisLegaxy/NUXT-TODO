## Note (For Express Backend)
This project structure is quite different from others, because I research throughout all the best practices in creating a perfect folder structure then I have came up with my own folder structure for ExpressJS

1. config (Consists of configurations file including database connection)
2. controllers (Consists of functions that handle HTTP methods)
3. middlewares (Consists of middlewares to handle request before it sends to the controllers)
4. models (Consists of models for modeling data)
5. plugins (Consists of plugins such as chalk, passportJS for authentication etc)
6. routes (Consists of API Endpoints)

### Side Note
For NuxtJS project structure I've followed the standard folder structure that comes with the package
